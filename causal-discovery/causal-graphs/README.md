# causal-graphs

This directory contains causal graphs from three different IoT scenarios, generated with CRAFTER:
- Scenario 1 ([s1.png](s1.png)):   This scenario involves an Autonomous Moving Robot (AMR) use case. We rely on the [TurtleBot5G Dataset](https://github.com/nilsjor/roboplan-datasets). The dataset is collected using a 5G-enabled TurtleBot within Ericsson reserach facilities at KTH, Sweden. The TurtleBot is equipped with a LiDAR sensor, utilizing 5G-enabled edge computing for data processing. LiDAR-based SLAM is used for real-time positioning, and regular network tests, such as Ping measurements to the edge server and iPerf3 throughput evaluations, are used to evaluate network conditions, such as throughput and latency.
- Scenario 2 ([s2.png](s2.png)): This scenario represents an IoT-enabled industrial anomaly detection use case. The dataset contains a detailed collection of performance and communication metrics from an industrial network environment that includes components such as an industrial production cell, where sensor data is sent to a data center through the backbone network. It consists of time-series data capturing both network-level activity and system-level behavior across multiple nodes distributed throughout the infrastructure. The measurements reflect real-world operational conditions, including data flow between critical components, timing variations in communication cycles, and throughput between applications and subsystems. For confidentiality reasons, the dataset used for generating the causal graph cannot be shared.
- Scenario 3 ([s3.png](s3.png)): This scenario represents an IoT-enabled energy management infrastructure for a large copper manufacturing plant. The dataset contains energy consumption data as well as sensor reading from various machinery parts, sampled at 1-minute intervals. The dataset contains readings spanning approximately 2 weeks. For confidentiality reasons, the dataset used for generating the causal graph cannot be shared.
